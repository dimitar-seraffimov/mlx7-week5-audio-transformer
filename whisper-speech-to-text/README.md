## Task 2: Fine-Tune Whisper, build a speech-controlled assistant

Goal for Friday’s Presentation
Demonstrate a live speech-to-text system that listens during the short presentation, transcribes in real time, and watches for 2–3 custom action words.

Example use: when I say a trigger word—like “play”, “stop”, or “save”—the app will:

    Play music on laptop

    Stop music playback

    Save the transcript to a file on Desktop

Key Features

    Real-time transcription using Whisper

    Keyword detection to trigger system commands

    Simple setup and demo during the live presentation
